## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your Recipe Finder app up and running locally.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18.x or higher)
*   npm or Yarn
*   A Supabase project (free tier available)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sirajulhugh/recipe.git
cd recipe-finder
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Configure Supabase

1.  **Create a Supabase Project**: If you don't have one, go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.
2.  **Get API Keys**:
    *   Navigate to `Project Settings` > `API` in your Supabase dashboard.
    *   Copy your `Project URL` and `anon public` key.
3.  **Set up Environment Variables**:
    *   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project.
    *   Add the following environment variables, replacing the placeholders with your actual Supabase keys:

    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
    ```

### 4. Database Setup

Run the following SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor to set up the necessary tables and Row Level Security (RLS) policies for user profiles and favorites.

```sql
-- Simple and reliable authentication setup
-- This script creates a minimal working auth system

-- Drop existing tables and functions to start fresh
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_auth_user_created ON auth.users;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS handle_new_user();
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS favorites CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS profiles CASCADE;

-- Create profiles table with simpler structure
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE UNIQUE,
  email TEXT,
  full_name TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create favorites table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS favorites (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  recipe_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  recipe_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  recipe_image TEXT,
  recipe_category TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, recipe_id)
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE favorites ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Simple RLS policies for profiles
CREATE POLICY "profiles_select_own" ON profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "profiles_insert_own" ON profiles
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "profiles_update_own" ON profiles
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Simple RLS policies for favorites
CREATE POLICY "favorites_select_own" ON favorites
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "favorites_insert_own" ON favorites
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "favorites_delete_own" ON favorites
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Grant permissions
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO anon, authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON profiles TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON favorites TO authenticated;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO authenticated;
```

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This project is optimized for deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), the creators of Next.js.

1.  **Push to GitHub**: Ensure your project is pushed to a GitHub repository.
2.  **Import to Vercel**: Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard), click "Add New..." > "Project", and import your Git repository.
3.  **Configure Environment Variables**: During the Vercel setup, add your `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` as environment variables. Make sure they are configured for the "Production" environment.
4.  **Deploy**: Vercel will automatically build and deploy your application.
